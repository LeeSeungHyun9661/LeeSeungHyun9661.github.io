  <h2 class="post-title">The Birth of Java</h2>
</div>
<p>
  In 1991, James Gosling at Sun Microsystems developed a new programming language called OAK. OAK was designed to be embedded in various electronic devices, but it faced hardware limitations and eventually shifted its focus to web development. However, the name OAK was already trademarked by Oak Technologies, so a new name had to be found.
</p>
<p>
  In 1995, James Gosling gathered relevant individuals to choose a new name for the programming language. Brainstorming sessions continued, and various names were proposed. Among them, Java was finally selected. Just as Java coffee from Indonesia's Java island inspires developers with its bittersweet taste, light acidity, and heavy body, modern developers are able to achieve a lot through the Java language.

<p class="mt-3">Java is widely used in various fields today. In particular, Java is a powerful tool for server-side web development, offering high performance and stability for developing and operating large-scale web applications. Java is also widely used in enterprise software development, helping to build and manage large business systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, Java is a mainstream language for developing Android applications. The Android operating system supports application development and distribution using Java-based languages, demonstrating the importance of Java in creating mobile applications used by millions of users.</p>
<p>Java is also used in database programming, game development, financial software, and more. Java provides compatibility across various platforms, making it advantageous for developing and running software in diverse environments.</p>

<!-- Features of Java -->
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-wrap flex-md-nowrap align-items-center pt-3 mb-3 border-bottom">
  <h2 class="post-title">Features and Advantages of Java</h2>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Key features of Java</strong>
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>: Java is an object-oriented language, offering concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Platform Independence</strong>: Unlike other programming languages that are converted to assembly code and affected by the hardware they run on, Java is compiled into bytecode and executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    <strong>Write Once, Run Anywhere!</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Memory Management</strong>: Java automatically manages memory through garbage collection, reducing issues such as memory leaks and eliminating the need for programmers to manually manage memory.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Robust Standard Library</strong>: Java offers a comprehensive standard library that simplifies implementing various functionalities, including networking, database access, GUI, and XML parsing.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multithreading Support</strong>: Java provides libraries and features that make implementing multithreading easy, improving performance through parallel processing.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security</strong>: Java emphasizes security with features like bytecode verification, class loaders, and a security manager, offering robust security mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p>These features make Java capable of running smoothly on any operating system, providing open-source libraries that support many users. With high stability and scalability, Java is consistently used in mobile and web application development.</p>
